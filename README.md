## 👋 Hi, I’m here for the vibes (and the widgets)

I’m a Flutter developer by trade and a professional doodler by passion.

Most of my serious, well-behaved, production-grade code lives in private organization repos doing its job quietly and responsibly.
This profile?
This is where curiosity runs slightly unsupervised.

## 🧠 What you’ll find here

* 🧩 Flutter experiments that started as “just testing something”
* 🌐 Web doodles when Dart needed a break
* 🐍 Python & Flask projects held together by logic and optimism
* 🔬 Half-finished ideas that *absolutely* made sense at 2 AM

No abandoned projects—only long-term incubations.

## 🛠️ Tech I enjoy breaking (and fixing)

* Flutter / Dart — main character energy
* Python & Flask — when I want things simple and fast
* Web stuff — HTML, CSS, JS (I visit, I don’t live there)
* APIs, tools, tiny utilities — because reinventing wheels is educational

## 📦 About this GitHub profile

* Public repos: for fun, learning, and mild chaos
* Private repos: for work, money, and responsibility
* Stars: appreciated
* Bugs: guaranteed
* Docs: written with good intentions

> If this profile looks quiet, that means the private repos are loud.

## 🚧 Disclaimer

Contents may include:

* TODOs I fully intend to finish
* Code written “just to see if it works”
* Experiments that worked once and were never touched again

Enter at your own curiosity.
