## 📅 Changelog (or how I pretend to be organized)

### v.0.1 (2025)

* 🎉 Initial commit! I swear it was a good idea at the time.
* 🐛 Fixed a bug in my motivation. It works for 3 hours, then crashes.

### v.0.2 (2025)

* 🧑‍💻 Added a Flutter widget because my phone was lonely.
* 📜 Wrote docs! Mostly for future-me to remember what I was doing.
* 🕵️‍♂️ Discovered 3 hidden bugs. I did *not* fix them. Yet.

### v.1.0 (2025)

* 🚀 Realized private repos exist. Suddenly, very professional.
* 💡 Created the "coolest" web app that no one will ever see.
* 🐍 Introduced Flask because Python was getting jealous of Dart.

### v.1.1 (2025)

* 🛠️ "Improved" performance by deleting unused code. Results are mixed.
* 🎨 Fixed UI in Flutter repo... or did I? (This one is still *pending*)
* 🕳️ Found a black hole in the project. Currently writing a paper on it.

### v.1.2 (2025)

* 🔥 Refactored entire project. 99% better. 1%… mysterious.
* ✨ Added "changelog" to give off that *professional* vibe.
* 🔄 Updated README for clarity. Turns out, the README was just “hey, I’m busy, don’t judge me."

---

### v.2.0 (2026) coming soon (maybe in 2027?)

* 🔮 Finally fixed that one bug from v0.2. Maybe.
* 🌍 Published my first full app. It’s going to be the next big thing. Probably.
* 🧃 Will add Flutter “juice” to every repo. (What does this mean? I have no idea.)
